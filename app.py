Early observational studies reported high rates of venous thromboembolism (vte) in critically ill patients with covid-2019. 1 a recent meta-analysis reported an incidence of 26% for vte among 3487 patients from 30 studies based on very low-quality evidence due to heterogeneity and risk of bias. 2 furthermore, studies have reported that elevated d-dimer values in covid-19 are associated with a higher risk of vte, mechanical ventilation, and mortality.\n\nMethods\n\nWe conducted a retrospective observational cohort study at new york-presbyterian hospital/weill cornell medical center and affiliated nonteaching hospital. We included all consecutive adult (age â‰¥18 years) cases of covid-19 confirmed by a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test admitted to our two hospitals between 3 march 2020, the date of the first positive case, and 15 may 2020. Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to evaluate the association between the initial d-dimer value during hospitalization, clinical characteristics, and the odds of vte.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 1739 hospitalized patients with covid-19 were included in the study. The median age was 66.5 years (iqr 53.7-77.3), 59% were men, and common comorbidities included hypertension (56%), diabetes mellitus (31%) and obesity (30%). Figure 1) . Multilevel likelihood ratios significantly changed at the following d-dimer levels: <1000 ng/ml: 0.14 (95% ci, 0.07-0.30); 1000-7500 ng/ ml: 1.19 (0.97-1.47); and >7500 n/l: 4.10 (2.94-5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn our study of a large cohort of hospitalized covid-19 patients in new york city the prevalence of objectively confirmed vte was 7%. 6 elevated d-dimer levels were associated with higher probability of vte, consistent with reports by others. 1 other significant predictors of v te in our cohort included black race, need for supplemental oxygen on presentation, higher platelet counts, and prolonged prothrombin time. 7 a possible explanation for this is that black patients have a greater prevalence of comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes, and may have sickle cell trait.\n\nData collection\n\nObjective: this study aimed to investigate the relationship between demographic, clinical characteristics and radiology characteristics of patients in a tertiary-care hospital and the quality of care provided by the radiology department. Methods: data were extracted manually from electronic medical records using a quality-controlled protocol in a redcap database. Data were analyzed using an algorithm-based automated process to extract vital signs and laboratory values from electronic records. Results: a total of 4,769 patients were enrolled in this study. Of whom, 1,832 (62.7%) were admitted to the hospital with a history of cancer. The majority (82.8%) had been admitted to a hospital in the tertiary care unit.\n\nClinical characteristics\n\nWe evaluated age, gender, race, ethnicity, comorbidities including obesity (defined as body mass index >30 kg/m 2 ), hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and active cancer.\n\n'
